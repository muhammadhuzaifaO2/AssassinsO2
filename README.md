# 👨‍💻 Muhammad Huzaifa – Portfolio

I am a full-stack engineer focused on designing and building cloud-native, end-to-end systems—from scalable backend services, modern web and mobile interfaces to production-ready AI models deployed in the cloud. My work spans system and solution architecture, full-stack web development, cross-platform mobile applications, and applied machine learning. I build reliable, high-performance systems using modern frontend frameworks, backend APIs, and cloud infrastructure, with AI models trained, evaluated, and integrated where they add real value. I prioritize clean architecture, performance, and maintainability, delivering systems that are both technically robust and user-focused.
